# Predictive Maintenance with AI  
**Hackathon Project: Real-time failure prediction for connected devices**  

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement  
Equipment failures disrupt services and incur high repair costs. By predicting failures in advance, businesses can schedule maintenance, reduce downtime, and save costs.  

## ðŸŒŸ Solution  
This AI-powered tool predicts device health using network logs (CPU usage, memory usage, error count). It includes:  
- A machine learning model for real-time failure prediction.  
- A REST API to serve predictions.  
- An interactive dashboard for end-users.  

## ðŸ’» Features  
1. Predict device health (Healthy or Fail).  
2. Real-time inputs via the dashboard.  
3. REST API for seamless integration.
